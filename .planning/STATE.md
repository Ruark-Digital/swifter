# Project State — SwiftPro FE

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Phase-2 QA + BE-Gap Remediation
**Current phase:** Phase 3 (FE Cleanup & Hardening) — Phases 1 & 2 largely shipped incrementally
Last activity: 2026-07-23 - Completed quick task 260723-0y0: prune dead approver/user redline-suggestion branches

## Status

Brownfield app under incremental remediation. Much of Phase 1 (BE-unblocked FE gaps) shipped in PR #267 on `fix/phase2-qa260719-fe-only` → `fix/phase2-bug-fixes`. Phase 2 QA batches are ongoing per the review docs. Phase 3 cleanup (dead-branch prune, test coverage, tab sole-owner) is next.

## Key Decisions

- GSD is the default workflow (CLAUDE.md §0). Quick-task mode is the common case.
- PRs target `fix/phase2-bug-fixes`; `main` is dead.
- FE absorbs BE field-name drift via dual-read where the spec is ambiguous.

## Blockers/Concerns

- QA78 "pick existing PM by id" is BE-blocked (endpoint not in docs.json v2.3.0).
- EditContract Step 2 still sends personnel on edit — Vendor Personnel tab is not yet sole owner (v2 requirement).
