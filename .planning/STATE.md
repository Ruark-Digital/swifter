# Project State — SwiftPro FE

**Milestone:** v1.0 — Phase-2 QA + BE-Gap Remediation
**Current phase:** Phase 3 (FE Cleanup & Hardening) — Phases 1 & 2 largely shipped incrementally
Last activity: 2026-07-23 - Completed quick task 260723-91v: make Vendor Personnel tab sole owner (stop EditContract/CreateMSADialog edit-PUT from sending personnel)

## Status

Brownfield app under incremental remediation. Much of Phase 1 (BE-unblocked FE gaps) shipped in PR #267 on `fix/phase2-qa260719-fe-only` → `fix/phase2-bug-fixes`. Phase 2 QA batches are ongoing per the review docs. Phase 3 cleanup (dead-branch prune, test coverage, tab sole-owner) is next.

## Key Decisions

- GSD is the default workflow (CLAUDE.md §0). Quick-task mode is the common case.
- PRs target `fix/phase2-bug-fixes`; `main` is dead.
- FE absorbs BE field-name drift via dual-read where the spec is ambiguous.

## Blockers/Concerns

- QA78 "pick existing PM by id" is BE-blocked (endpoint not in docs.json v2.3.0).
- Step 2 personnel chips in EditContract.tsx and CreateMSADialog.tsx (edit mode) still render and are editable, but changes made there are now silently discarded on save (payload no longer sends personnel on edit, as of 260723-91v). A follow-up task should make these chips read-only/hidden during edit and redirect to the Vendor Personnel tab.
